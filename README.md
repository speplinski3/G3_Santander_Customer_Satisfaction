## Overview 
* **Purpose:** To put data from a Airline Customer Satisfaction Survey through various Machine Learning Models to best predict passenger customer satisfaction. Exploratory Data Analysis is performed to determine important factors in customer satisfaction. This helps the company better understand what goes into customer satisfaction in turn reducing customer churn.

* **Data Source:**
